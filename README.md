About
=====

The idea behind the group is to make propositions on how to implement Domain Driven Design in your php projects. We, developers, are often far from how to implement the vision that business experts for which we create applications.

It often results problems in the long term about either code don't represent reality or bad repartition of responsabilities, platform scalability, and so on.


Goals
=====

We don't want to prove that we're right. We juste want to make proposals and give our point of view about why we think it's good to (re)think the design of php's object oriented projects.

To do so we want to provide spec files as a journey to implement DDD & CQRS principles into your daily projects.
